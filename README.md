# Section 02: General Information
The task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. The program should configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

# Section 03: My experience
## models
This section was easy, I jsut had to search for the validations to see if they were correctly written. This was just add lists and that is it.

## routes
I feel like this part is of the most importance and really simple, but the courses go way beyond to explain a lot of information that could be sumarized, and has a lot of important information that is just brushed by.
After asking around, and searching the material we have, I came to the realization that this part was so simple in all the ways possible.
